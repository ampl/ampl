  Fix another bug that could only bite after a very large number of
commands.  Note that using iterated commands, such as iterated "let",
"printf", "drop", etc.  commands, rather than "for" loops, where
appropriate can greatly reduce the number of commands executed and
give much faster executions.  Using slices suitably sometimes also
greatly speeds up execution.
