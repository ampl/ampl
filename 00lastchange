  Fix a bug with "option linelim 0;" that affected some complicated
examples involving linear and nonlinear defined variables.  The linear
variables were sometimes evaluated after nonlinear variables that used
them, leading to wrong values for the nonlinear defined variables.
Note that "option linelim 0" can lead to substantially faster
processing of some problems, but makes linear defined variables
appears as nonlinear.  For some nonlinear solvers, this makes no
difference, but it cannot be used with purely linear solvers.
  Somewhat improve performance in handling many linear defined
variables with the default "option linelim 1".  In one example, time
to invoke the solver was reduced by 16%.
  The "temporary" debugging interpretation of the "4" bit of $linelim,
describe in the change-log entry of 20011206, is rescinded.  (Version
20130407 had a glitch in this change.)
