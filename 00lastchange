  Extend test for "no variables, but lower bound = ..." to fix a glitch
with "option presolve 0" (which is often a bad idea) whereby infeasible
constraints with no variables were eliminated when defined variables
were present.  When no defined variables are present, such infeasible
constraints are passed to the solver.
