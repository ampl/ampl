  Fix a bug with loop invariants having internal dummy variables.
In the following example, the inner sum was moved to the wrong
place, giving a fault:

  set I; set J; set S within {I,J} default {};;
  param p{i in I} = sum{z in {0}: sum{j in J: (i,j) in S} 1 > 0} 1;
  let I := 1..10; let J := I;
  display p;

In this example, "sum{j in J: (i,j) in S} 1" is a bizarre way of
writing what more clearly and efficiently would be written
"card{(i,j) in S}"; making this change bypassed the bug, as did
changing the inner sum to the clumsier "sum{(i,j) in S} 1".
