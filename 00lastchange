  Fix a bug involving imported functions and defined variables,
illustrated by the example:

	load amplgsl.dll;
	function gsl_cdf_ugaussian_P;
	param y default 0;
	var theta;
	var z = gsl_cdf_ugaussian_P(theta*y);
	display z;

which said "z = 0" rather than "z = 0.5".  The bug was that after 0
was substituted for theta*y (since y has its default value 0),
gsl_cdf_ugaussian_P(0) was ignored.
