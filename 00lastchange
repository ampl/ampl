  Fix a bug in deducing reduced costs involving nonlinear if-then-else
expressions whose "if" test has a "count" expression.  Such expressions
are unlikely in practice; /netlib/ampl/changes has an example.
  Fix a bug with default expressions for scalar params:  if evaluation
of the default expression failed, e.g., due to a missing value, the
param subsequently appeared to have an unpredictable value.  This was
only an issue in an interactive session.
  Add a complaint about integer variables declared with bounds that
when rounded (up for the lower bound, down for the upper bound) to
integer values are inconsistent.
