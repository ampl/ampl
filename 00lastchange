  Fix a glitch with _ncons, which incorrectly gave the number of
algebraic constraints plus the number of logical constraints
rather than just the number of algebraic constraints, i.e.,
_ncons was high by _nlogcons.
  Not previously noted in the change log are generic synonyms
for logical constraints:

	Name		Meaning
	_nlogcons	number of logical constraints before presolve
			in the current problem
	_snlogcons	number of logical constraints after presolve,
			i.e., as seen by the solver
	_logcon		indexed by {1 .. _nlogcons}: true (1) or
			false (0) values of logical constraints before
			presolve
	_slogcon	indexed by {1 .. _snlogcons}: true or false
			values (1 or 0) of logical constraints seen
			by the solver
	_logconname	indexed by {1 .. _nlogcons}: names of logical
			constraints in the current problem
	_slogconname	indexed by {1 .. _snlogcons}: names of logical
			constraints after presolve
