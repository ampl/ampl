  Fix a bug, leading to "unexpected type ... in lsimplify()", with <==>
in logical constraints.
  Fix bugs with logical expressions involving "not" (i.e., "!") and
inequalities involving NaNs.
  Similarly, in the (silly) model
	var x; s.t. c: 1 < 2 ==> !(x > 4);
render c as the logical constraint !(x > 4) rather than the arithmetic
constraint x <= 4.
