  Fix a bug "solve" involving complementarity constraints, followed
by "fix" command(s) that remove all complementarity constraints,
followed by a "solve":  an incorrect .nl file was written for the
second "solve".
  Fix an optimization bug with tests of the forms

	expr != numeric_expression
	expr == numeric_expression
	numeric_expression != expr
	numeric_expression == expr

If expr was not numeric, the numeric_expression was not evaluated, so an
error in it was not detected.  Example:

	set S = {'abc'}; print{i in S, j in S: i != j+1}: i,j;

printed "abc abc" rather than complaining that j+1 cannot be evaluated.
  Fix an obscure bug with complementarity constraints that led to an
error message of the form "presolve has k = nnn, P.nfc = mmm".
