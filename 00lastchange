  Fix a bug with logical constraints:  on problems having both logical and
algebraic constraints, when presolve eliminated all logical constraints
but not all algebraic constraints, a fault was possible.  Now, on other
problems, "Solution determined by presolve" is more often possible.
  Fix a bug with "display _logcon;" on problems having both logical and
arithmetic constraints:  wrong values were displayed.  The bug did not
affect, e.g., "display {i in 1 .. _nlogcons} _logcon[i];".
