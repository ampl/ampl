  Fix a glitch with error recovery:  after an error message about
"no value for ...", supplying the data and then trying to solve
sometimes led to an invalid .nl file.  Example (typed on stdin):

	set I = 1..2; var x{I} >= 0; param p{I};
	s.t. c: sum{i in I} x[i] + sum{i in I} 2*x[i] <= 3;
	minimize zot: sum{i in I} p[i];
	solve; # error processing objective zot: no value for p[1]
	data; param p := 1 -1 2 -2; solve; # bad line 22 of ....nl

  Fix a glitch giving an "unexpected nonvariable type..." error
message when option presolve 0 is unwisely used with certain
logical constraints involving "exists" or "forall".
