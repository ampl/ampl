 

EXAMPLES OF CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING FORMULATIONS

--> see also www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGICpaper! <--


GROUP ASSIGNMENT
assign0.mod/dat/run -- 
   integer program for assignment of students to project groups
assign1.mod/dat/run -- 
   constraint program for assignment of students to project groups.
   using "numberof" operator
assign1a.mod/dat -- 
   same but with object-valued (specifically, project-valued) variables

BALANCED GROUP ASSIGNMENT
balassign0.mod/dat --
   integer program for assignment of people to groups 
   so that each group is "balanced" by various criteria
balassign1.mod/dat --
   constraint program for balanced assignment of people to groups,
   using "numberof" operator

MAGIC SEQUENCE
magic.mod -- 
   constraint program for finding a magic sequence of length n+1
   (jth number in the sequence equals number of js in the sequence)
   using "numberof" operator

N QUEENS
nqueens0.mod --
   integer program for the n queens problem: put n queens on an
   n-by-n chessboard so that no queen is attacking any other queen
nqueens.mod --
   constraint program for the n queens problem,
   using the "alldiff" operator

PROGRESSIVE PARTY PROBLEM
party1.mod/dat --
   constraint program for the progressive party problem,
   using "alldiff", "atmost", "if-then", "!=" as logic operators
party2.mod/dat -- 
   alternative constraint program using "==>" as an "implies" op
[for a MIP formulation see E. Kalvelagen, 
   Computers and Operations Research 30 (2003) 1713-1726]

PLANT SCHEDULING
plantsched5.mod/dat --
   integer program for plant scheduling subject to various rules
plantsched5a.mod/dat --
   constraint program for the same, using "atmost" and "or"
   and avoiding all zero-one variables
