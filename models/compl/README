The models in this directory express complementarity problems mentioned
in the test results (or examples) shown in

Michael C. Ferris, Robert Fourer, and David M. Gay, "Expressing
	Complementarity Problems in an Algebraic Modeling Language
	and Communicating Them to Solvers", forthcoming report.

Most of the models in this directory started out as GAMS models in MCPLIB,
ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/math-prog/mcplib .

Papers describing these models and other possible complementarity
models are:

Steven P. Dirkse and Michael C. Ferris, "MCPLIB: A Collection of Nonlinear Mixed
	Complementarity Problem", Optimization Methods and Software 5 (1995),
	pp. 319-345.

	Complementarity Problems", SIAM Review 39 (1997), pp. 669-713.

runall is an AMPL script that exercises most of the models.
