This directory contains CMake modules for finding various software libraries.
To use any of the modules, first add the path to this directory to the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH variable in CMakeLists.txt:

  set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} /path/to/ampl/cmake)

and then load the module with the find_package command, for example:

  find_package(CPLEX)

This will define the variables such as CPLEX_FOUND. See the comment section at
the beginning of the module for details.

Modules:

  FindCPLEX.cmake - finds the CPLEX, Concert, IloCplex and CP Optimizer
                    libraries
  FindODBC.cmake  - finds the ODBC libraries
