This directory contains the AMPL solver and function library tests implemented
using the Google C++ Testing Framework (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
also known as Google Test. The "gtest" subdirectory contains the source code
for Google Test. The source code for the framework is stored here because it
is recommended that each project compiles Google Test itself instead of using
pre-compiled libraries. See the Google Test FAQ at http://bit.ly/JiWbQw for
details.

Building the tests:

1. Install CMake which can be downloaded from
   http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

2. Build the AMPL solver library in the "solvers" directory. Note that on
   Windows the AMPL solver library should be built with the shared (DLL)
   runtime using the command "nmake RUNTIME=-MD -f makefile.vc". This is
   necessary to avoid linkage errors with IBM ILOG CP Optimizer which doesn't
   provide libraries linked with static runtime.

3. Generate the makefiles using the command "cmake .".

4. Build the tests with the command "make".

Once the tests have been built invoke "make test" to run them.
