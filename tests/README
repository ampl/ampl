This directory contains the AMPL solver tests implemented using the Google C++
Testing Framework (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/) also known as Google
Test. The "gtest" subdirectory contains the source code for Google Test.
The source code for the framework is stored here because it is recommended
that each project compiles Google Test itself instead of using pre-compiled
libraries. See the Google Test FAQ at http://bit.ly/JiWbQw for details.

To build the tests you need to have CMake which can be downloaded from
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Once you have CMake installed, invoke "cmake ." to generate Makefiles and then
"make" to build the tests and "make test" to run them.
