This directory contains the AMPL solver and function library tests implemented
using the Google C++ Testing Framework (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
also known as Google Test. The "gtest" subdirectory contains the source code
for Google Test. The source code for the framework is stored here because it
is recommended that each project compiles Google Test itself instead of using
pre-compiled libraries. See the Google Test FAQ "Why is it not recommended
to install a pre-compiled copy of Google Test (for example, into /usr/local)?"
at http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/FAQ for more details.

See the INSTALL file in the top-level directory for instructions on building
and running the tests.
