 tableproxy.c:  when a shared-library name (such as ampltabl.dll)
does not contain a slash (or, for MS Windows, start with a drive
letter), have tableproxy*.exe look in $ampl_libpath (if set) for the
library.  Note that AMPL versions starting with 20120404 export
$ampl_libpath.  When $ampl_libpath is not set, behave as though
$ampl_libpath were set to the current directory.
