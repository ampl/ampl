  amplodbc.c:  adjustments by Victor Zverovich to make ODBC table
handlers for Linux with unixODBC (http://www.unixodbc.org) or iODBC
(http://www.iodbc.org) in adition to MS Windows (as heretofore).
  README: update to mention _HANDLERS, _handler_desc, and recent
extensions to simplify mixing 32- and 64-bit binaries.
  Split makefile.linux into makefile.linux and makefile.linux64
(for making 32- and 64-bit entities, respectively, and adjusting
to include both the ODBC and tableproxy handlers in ampltabl.dll,
with a new rule for tableproxy.dll that just has the tableproxy
handler.
