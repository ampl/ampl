  cplex.c: add zerohalfcuts to the cuts simultaneously controlled
by mipcuts.  Update to CPLEX 12.5:  add keywords dettimelim,
polishafter_timedet, probetimedet, seed, and tunetimedet, and extend
timing keyword to allow requesting times in platform-specific "ticks",
which CPLEX computes in an unspecified way.
