The solver "gecode" uses Gecode (http://www.gecode.org/) to solve
constraint programming problems.  Solver binaries are available for
download at https://code.google.com/p/ampl/downloads/list?q=gecode.

Normally the gecode solver is invoked by AMPL's solve command,
which gives the invocation

     gecode stub -AMPL

in which stub.nl is an AMPL generic output file (possibly written
by "ampl -obstub" or "ampl -ogstub").  After solving the problem,
the solver writes a stub.sol file for use by ampl's solve and solution
commands.  When you run ampl, this all happens automatically if you
give the AMPL commands

     option solver gecode;
     solve;

You can control the solver by setting the environment variable
gecode_options appropriately (either by using ampl's option command,
or by using the shell's set and export commands before you invoke ampl).
You can put one or more (white-space separated) phrases in
$gecode_options.  A few of the phrases are single words:

     Phrase       Meaning

     version      Report version details before solving the problem.

Others are name-value pairs, possibly separated by '=', as in

     wantsol 1
or
     wantsol=1
or
     wantsol = 1

any of which make the gecode driver write .sol file in a stand-alone
invocation (no -AMPL on the command line).

The following command prints the full list of options with descriptions:

     gecode -=

-----------------------
solve_result_num values
=======================

Here is a table of solve_result_num values that "gecode" can return
to an AMPL session, along with the text that appears in the associated
solve_message.

        Value   Message

          0     optimal solution
        100     feasible solution
        200     infeasible problem
        600     interrupted

-------------------

If you invoke "gecode stub -AMPL" or "gecode stub", you can also
supply additional command-line arguments of the form name=value.
Such arguments override specifications in $gecode_options.  Example:

     ampl -obfoo foo.model foo.data
     nohup gecode -s foo 2>>err&

to solve a problem whose solution will take a while; after it finishes,

     ampl foo.model foo.data -
     solution foo.sol;
     display ... /* things involving the computed solution */;

(Here, - denotes standard input, and ampl reads the "solution..."
and "display..." lines.)

--------
Suffixes
========

You can use the suffix icl to specify integer consistency level for
constraints:

  subj to c1: alldiff ({i in 1..n} q[i]) suffix icl icl_dom;

This suffix and possible values for it are defined in gecode.ampl.
Requires AMPL version 20130906 or later.
