The solver "sulum" uses Sulum (http://http://www.sulumoptimization.com/)
to solve LP or MIP problems.

Normally the sulum solver is invoked by AMPL's solve command,
which gives the invocation

     sulum stub -AMPL

in which stub.nl is an AMPL generic output file (possibly written
by "ampl -obstub" or "ampl -ogstub").  After solving the problem,
the solver writes a stub.sol file for use by ampl's solve and solution
commands.  When you run ampl, this all happens automatically if you
give the AMPL commands

     option solver sulum;
     solve;

You can control the solver by setting the environment variable
sulum_options appropriately (either by using ampl's option command,
or by using the shell's set and export commands before you invoke ampl).
You can put one or more (white-space separated) phrases in
$sulum_options.  A few of the phrases are single words:

     Phrase       Meaning

     version      Report version details before solving the problem.

Others are name-value pairs, possibly separated by '=', as in

     wantsol 1
or
     wantsol=1
or
     wantsol = 1

any of which make the sulum driver write .sol file in a stand-alone
invocation (no -AMPL on the command line).

The following command prints the full list of options with descriptions:

     sulum -=

solve_result_num values
=======================

Here is a table of solve_result_num values that "sulum" can return
to an AMPL session, along with the text that appears in the associated
solve_message.

        Value   Message

          0     optimal solution
        200     infeasible problem
        600     interrupted

-------------------

If you invoke "sulum stub -AMPL" or "sulum stub", you can also
supply additional command-line arguments of the form name=value.
Such arguments override specifications in $sulum_options.  Example:

     ampl -obfoo foo.model foo.data
     nohup sulum -s foo 2>>err&

to solve a problem whose solution will take a while; after it finishes,

     ampl foo.model foo.data -
     solution foo.sol;
     display ... /* things involving the computed solution */;

(Here, - denotes standard input, and ampl reads the "solution..."
and "display..." lines.)
