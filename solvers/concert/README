The solver "concert" uses IBM ILOG CPLEX CP Optimizer to solve
constraint programming problems or CPLEX to solve integer, mixed-integer,
linear programming, and quadratic problems, possibly involving integer
variables.  Both CP Optimizer and CPLEX are used through the Concert
API which explains the solver name.  Normally the concert solver is
invoked by AMPL's solve command, which gives the invocation

     concert stub -AMPL

in which stub.nl is an AMPL generic output file (possibly written
by "ampl -obstub" or "ampl -ogstub").  After solving the problem,
the solver writes a stub.sol file for use by ampl's solve and solution
commands.  When you run ampl, this all happens automatically if you
give the AMPL commands

     option solver concert;
     solve;

You can control the solver by setting the environment variable
concert_options appropriately (either by using ampl's option command,
or by using the shell's set and export commands before you invoke ampl).
You can put one or more (white-space separated) phrases in
$concert_options.  A few of the phrases are single words:

     Phrase       Meaning

     ilogcplex    Use IBM ILOG CPLEX optimizer.

     ilogsolver   Use IBM ILOG Constraint Programming optimizer.

Others are name-value pairs, possibly separated by '=', as in

     timelimit 600
or
     timelimit=600
or
     timelimit = 600

any of which limits CP Optimizer search time to 600 seconds.  Options such
as logverbosity, that take enumerated list of values, accept both numeric
and string values, so

     logverbosity=terse

is equivalent to

     logverbosity=1

In particular, switches that take values 0 or 1 also accept values
"off" or "on".

The following command prints the full list of options with descriptions:

     concert -=

solve_result_num values
=======================

Here is a table of solve_result_num values that "concert" can return
to an AMPL session, along with the text that appears in the associated
solve_message.

        Value   Message

          0     optimal solution
        100     feasible solution
        200     infeasible problem
        201     infeasible or unbounded problem
        300     unbounded problem
        500     error

-------------------

If you invoke "concert stub -AMPL" or "concert stub", you can also
supply additional command-line arguments of the form name=value.
Such arguments override specifications in $concert_options.  Example:

     ampl -obfoo foo.model foo.data
     nohup concert -s foo timing=1 2>>times&

to solve a problem whose solution will take a while; after it finishes,

     ampl foo.model foo.data -
     solution foo.sol;
     display ... /* things involving the computed solution */;

(Here, - denotes standard input, and ampl reads the "solution..."
and "display..." lines.)
