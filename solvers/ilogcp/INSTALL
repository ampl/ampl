This file describes how to build and install "ilogcp", the AMPL driver
for IBM ILOG CP Optimizer and CPLEX.

Requirements
------------

To build the ilogcp driver you should have IBM ILOG CP Optimizer,
CPLEX and Concert installed.  Normally these are installed as parts of
IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.  The code has been tested with
Optimization Studio version 12.

You should also build AMPL Solver Library (ASL) prior to building
ilogcp.  Suppose you have AMPL repository containing ASL, example
models, etc in directory ${AMPL_DIR}.  The repository can be obtained
from https://github.com/vitaut/ampl/.  ASL can be built as follows:

  cd ${AMPL_DIR}/solvers
  ./configurehere
  make

On Windows the AMPL solver library should be built with the shared (DLL)
runtime using the command "nmake RUNTIME=-MD -f makefile.vc".  This is
necessary to avoid linkage errors with IBM ILOG CP Optimizer which doesn't
provide libraries linked with static runtime.
   
Build using CMake
-----------------

An included CMake build script (CMakeLists.txt) can be used to build
the ilogcp driver on a wide range of platforms.  You can download CMake
for free from http://www.cmake.org/.

CMake works by generating native makefiles or build projects that can
be used in the compiler environment of your choice.  The typical
workflow starts with:

  mkdir mybuild      # Create a directory to hold the build output.
  cd mybuild
  cmake ${AMPL_DIR}  # Generate native build scripts.

If you are on a *nix system, you should now see a Makefile in the
current directory.  Now you can build ilogcp as follows:

  cd solvers/ilogcp
  make ilogcp

If you use Windows and have Vistual Studio installed, a ilogcp.sln file
and several .vcproj files will be created.  You can then build them
using Visual Studio.

On Mac OS X with Xcode installed, a .xcodeproj file will be generated.

Build without CMake
-------------------

Alternatively you can build the ilogcp driver with make using the
provided makefile (makefile.u).  First edit the makefile to specify
the path to CPLEX Optimization Studio.  Then type "make -f makefile.u"
to build ilogcp.
