  asl.h, fgh_read.c, fg_read.c, misc.c: pfghread.c, pfg_read.c:  move
some common operations to misc.c, where they will happen after some
problem adjustments.
  mpec_adj.c: fix bugs in handling problems with integer (including
binary) variables.
  suf_sos.c, writesol.c: tweak to work with some problem modifications.
  getstub.c, getstub.h: add variant usage_noexit_ASL() of usage_ASL()
(same calling sequence: the exit-code argument affects where the
usage information is written) that does not exit.  This alternate
routine may be withdrawn if it we do not see convincing examples of
its utility.
