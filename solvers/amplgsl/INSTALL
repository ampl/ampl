This file describes how to build and install "amplgsl", the AMPL function
library providing bindings for the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).

Requirements
------------

To build the amplgsl library you should have GSL installed.  The code has
been tested with GSL version 1.15.

You can download and build GSL using the "get-gsl" script.

You should also build AMPL Solver Library (ASL) prior to building
amplgsl.  Suppose you have AMPL repository containing ASL, example
models, etc in directory ${AMPL_DIR}.  The repository can be obtained
from https://github.com/vitaut/ampl/.  ASL can be built as follows:

  cd ${AMPL_DIR}/solvers
  ./configurehere
  make

Build using CMake
-----------------

An included CMake build script (CMakeLists.txt) can be used to build
the amplgsl library on a wide range of platforms.  You can download CMake
for free from http://www.cmake.org/.

CMake works by generating native makefiles or build projects that can
be used in the compiler environment of your choice.  The typical
workflow starts with:

  mkdir mybuild      # Create a directory to hold the build output.
  cd mybuild
  cmake ${AMPL_DIR}  # Generate native build scripts.

If you are on a *nix system, you should now see a Makefile in the
current directory.  Now you can build amplgsl as follows:

  cd solvers/amplgsl
  make amplgsl

If you use Windows and have Vistual Studio installed, an AMPL.sln file
and several .vcproj files will be created.  You can then build them
using Visual Studio.

On Mac OS X with Xcode installed, a .xcodeproj file will be generated.

Build without CMake
-------------------

Alternatively you can build the amplgsl library with make using the
provided makefile (makefile.u).  First edit the makefile to specify
the path to GSL if necessary.  Then type "make -f makefile.u" to build
amplgsl.
